malu - mechanical alu
=====================

I have been fascinated by the idea of mechanical computing for many years. This project contains notes, diagrams, and other bits related to this.

A lot of this is based on Ralph C. Merkle's article "Two Types of Mechanical Reversible Logic" at http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/mechano.html. While this article focuses primarily on computing at the nano level, I am interested in bigger - much bigger. If I could figure out how to build these using massive I-Beams, I would.
